# PalindroneCheckerApp
# I have used java program to display the details 
# I mentioned version and welcome message
# This Java application checks whether a given string is a palindrome by reversing the string and comparing it with the original value.
# This use case introduces transformation-based validation, where the input is reversed before comparison.
# The UC4....The program turns that word into a list of characters.
# In UC5 we check if a word is a palindrone by using a Stack data structure.
# The program uses the "Last In First Out" rule, which naturally reverses the order of characters.
