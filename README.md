# PalindroneCheckerApp
# I have used java program to display the details 
# I mentioned version and welcome message
# This Java application checks whether a given string is a palindrome by reversing the string and comparing it with the original value.
# This use case introduces transformation-based validation, where the input is reversed before comparison.
# The UC4....The program turns that word into a list of characters.
# In UC5 we check if a word is a palindrone by using a Stack data structure.
# The program uses the "Last In First Out" rule, which naturally reverses the order of characters.
# The UC6 is to demonstrate the difference between FIFO and LIFO while validating a palindrome.
# By comparing the front of the Queue with the top of the Stack, the program can determine if the string reads the same both ways.
# The UC7 is to validate a palindrome using a Deque (Double Ended Queue) for bidirectional comparison.
# Unlike standard queues, a Deque allows you to access and remove elements from both the front and the rear.
